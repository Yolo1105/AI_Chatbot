  utter_data_management_intro:
  - text: 'The NYU HPC Environment provides access to a number of file systems to
      better serve the needs of researchers managing data during the various stages
      of the research data lifecycle (data capture, analysis, archiving,, etc.). '
  
  utter_data_storage_options:
  - text: User Home Directories, HPC Scratch, HPC Vast, HPC Research Project Space,
      HPC Work, HPC Archive
  
  utter_did_that_help:
  - text: Did that help you?
  
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: Bye
  
  utter_greet:
  - text: Hey! How are you?
  
  utter_happy:
  - text: Great, carry on!
  
  utter_high_risk_data:
  - text: High-risk data should be stored in Secure Research Data Environments (SRDE),
      not on the HPC.
  
  utter_high_risk_data_warning:
  - text: Because the HPC system is not approved for High Risk data, we recommend
      using an approved system like the  Secure Research Data Environments (SRDE).
  
  utter_hpc_data_management:
  - text: HPC data management involves various file systems to handle data during
      the research lifecycle, including storage, analysis, and archiving.
  
  utter_hpc_data_transfers:
  - text: Data transfer in HPC can be done using SCP or the Data Transfer Node, depending
      on file size and location.
  
  utter_hpc_definition:
  - text: High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the practice of aggregating computing
      power in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out
      of a typical desktop computer or workstation, enabling the solution of complex
      data processing challenges, scientific problems, and simulations.

  utter_ask_high_risk_data:
  - text: HPC is not approved for storing or analyzing High Risk data such as Personally 
      Identifiable Information (PII) or electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). 
      For high-risk data, you should use the Secure Research Data Environment (SRDE), 
      which is specifically approved for handling such sensitive data.

  utter_hpc_scratch_purging:
  - text: HPC scratch storage has a purging policy where files are deleted after 60
      days of inactivity.
  
  utter_hpc_sharing_data:
  - text: For sharing data in HPC, using Research Project Space or shared scratch
      directories is recommended.
  
  utter_hpc_storage_comparison:
  - text: Each storage system in HPC serves different purposes, with home directories
      for code, scratch for temporary data, and project space for shared research
      files.
  
  utter_iamabot:
  - text: I am a bot, powered by Rasa.
  
  utter_moderate_risk_data:
  - text: HPC allows storage of moderate-risk data, but not high-risk data such as
      PII or ePHI.
  
  utter_moderate_risk_data_warning:
  - text: The HPC Environment has been approved for storing and analyzing Moderate
      Risk research data, as defined in the NYU Electronic Data and System Risk Classification
      Policy. High Risk research data, such as those that include Personal Identifiable
      Information (PII) or electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) or Controlled
      Unclassified Information (CUI) should NOT be stored in the HPC Environment.
      Please note that only the Office of Sponsored Projects (OSP) and Global Office
      of Information Security (GOIS) are empowered to classify the risk categories
      of data.
  
  utter_user_home_dir:
  - text: Every individual user has a home directory (under `/home/$USER`, environment
      variable `$HOME`) for permanently storing code and important configuration files.
      Home Directories provide limited storage space (50 GB) and inodes (files) 30,000
      per user. Users can check their quota utilization using the `myquota` command.

  utter_ask_hpc_scratch_purging:
  - text: HPC scratch storage has a purging policy where files are deleted after 60
      days of inactivity. Be sure to archive important data or move it to a backed-up
      location like Research Project Space or your home directory.

  utter_ask_hpc_storage_comparison:
  - text: HPC offers several storage options including user home directories, scratch
      space, vast, and research project space. Home directories are limited and backed
      up daily, while scratch and vast provide high-performance, temporary storage
      for active projects, subject to purging policies.

  utter_ask_hpc_data_transfers:
  - text: Data transfers within the HPC can be done via SCP or the Data Transfer Node
      (gDTN). Use these methods to move data between systems or bring data into HPC
      for processing.

  utter_ask_hpc_sharing_data:
  - text: For sharing data on HPC, use the Research Project Space or shared scratch
      directories. Research Project Space is ideal for long-term collaborations, while
      scratch is better for temporary data sharing during active projects.
